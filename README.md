### Welcome To My GitHub Rep

My name is Austin, at the moment I enjoy working on FiveM scripts and hope to move into more fullstack dev applications and am currently working on mastering javascript. I hope 
to also make some Discord bots in the near future. I also hope on realising some public projects soon!
